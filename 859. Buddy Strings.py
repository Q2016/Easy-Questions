Question:
Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.
Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

 
 

 
Solution:
Zip and compare element by element
 
    def buddyStrings(self, A, B):
        if len(A) != len(B): return False
        if A == B and len(set(A)) < len(A): return True
        dif = [(a, b) for a, b in zip(A, B) if a != b]
        return len(dif) == 2 and dif[0] == dif[1][::-1]

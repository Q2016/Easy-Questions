Question:
Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.
Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
  
Solution:
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, S: str, T: str) -> bool:
        
        
        def build(S):
            ans = []
            for c in S:
                if c != '#':
                    ans.append(c)
                elif ans:
                    ans.pop()
            return "".join(ans)
        return build(S) == build(T)

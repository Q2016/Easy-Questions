Question:
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

class Solution:
    def maxSubArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        maxSub=nums[0]
        curSum=0
        
        for n in nums:
            if curSum<0:
                curSum=0
            curSum+=n
            maxSub=max(maxSub, curSum)
        return maxSub

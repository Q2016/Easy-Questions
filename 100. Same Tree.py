Question:
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.









Solution: Recursive
    
check current nodes value then check right and left legs of two trees  

    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
    
        # p and q are both None
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        # one of p and q is None
        if not q or not p:
            return False
        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        return self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right) and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left)

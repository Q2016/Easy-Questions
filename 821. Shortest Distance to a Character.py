Question:
Given a string s and a character c that occurs in s, return an array of integers answer where answer.length == s.length and 
answer[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurrence of character c in s.
The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j), where abs is the absolute value function.

Example 1:
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = "e"
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
Explanation: The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5, but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

Solution:
For each index S[i], let's try to find the distance to the next character C going left, and going right. The answer is the minimum of these two values.
When going left to right, we'll remember the index prev of the last character C we've seen. Then the answer is i - prev.
When going right to left, we'll remember the index prev of the last character C we've seen. Then the answer is prev - i.
We take the minimum of these two answers to create our final answer.

class Solution(object):
    def shortestToChar(self, S, C):
        prev = float('-inf')
        ans = []
        for i, x in enumerate(S):
            if x == C: prev = i
            ans.append(i - prev)

        prev = float('inf')
        for i in xrange(len(S) - 1, -1, -1):
            if S[i] == C: prev = i
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], prev - i)

        return ans

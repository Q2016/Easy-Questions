Question:
There is a fence with n posts, each post can be painted with one of the k colors.
You have to paint all the posts such that no more than two adjacent fence posts have the same color.
Return the total number of ways you can paint the fence.

Sample I/O
Example 1
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Take c1 as color 1, c2 as color 2. All possible ways are:

            post1  post2  post3      
 -----      -----  -----  -----       
   1         c1     c1     c2 
   2         c1     c2     c1 
   3         c1     c2     c2 
   4         c2     c1     c1  
   5         c2     c1     c2
   6         c2     c2     c1



Solution:
This question can be solved by Dynamic Programming implicitly. I did not figure out the solution until I found a great video 
from youtube. And the explaination is very clear. I am going to share here.

def numWays(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return k
        same, dif = k, k*(k-1)
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            same, dif = dif, (same+dif)*(k-1)
        return same + dif


The total cost is will be O(n-2)

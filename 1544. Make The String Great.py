Question:
Given a string s of lower and upper case English letters.
A good string is a string which doesn't have two adjacent characters where:
s[i] is a lower-case letter and s[i + 1] is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa.
To make the string good, you can choose two adjacent characters that make the string bad and remove them. 
You can keep doing this until the string becomes good.
Return the string after making it good. 

Example 1:
Input: s = "leEeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: In the first step, either you choose i = 1 or i = 2, both will result "leEeetcode" to be reduced to "leetcode".

    
    
    
    
    
Solution: One pass
Just check if next character makes the string bad, if so pop the stack. Otherwise, push to the stack.
Time: O(N)
Space: O(N)

class Solution:
    def makeGood(self, s: str) -> str:
        result = []
        for c in s:
            if not result:
                result.append(c)
            elif result[-1].isupper() and result[-1].lower() == c:
                result.pop()
            elif result[-1].islower() and result[-1].upper() == c:
                result.pop()
            else:
                result.append(c)
        return ''.join(result)
